Getting Python
--------------
You can't use the version of python that comes from MacOS or the package manager. You have to use
"Homebrew", which you get from some script you run (just search Homebrew install)

brew install python.
brew link python

Command is "python3" and "pip3"

PyInstaller
-------------
PyInstaller will fail to build. You have to get the latest version using:

  pip uninstall pyinstaller
  PYINSTALLER_COMPILE_BOOTLOADER=1 pip install git+https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.git@develop

Apple Silicon
--------------
Have to get a rosetta version of your terminal, then get a rosetta version of homebrew and alias it, then
install python3 through the intel homebrew and use specifically it to make your virtual environment
