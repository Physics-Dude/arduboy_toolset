<h1>Frequently Asked Questions on Arduboy</h1>


<h2>Common terms</h2>

<h3>What is a "sketch"?</h3>
<p>
    A sketch is a program for Arduino. When you hear "sketch", you can think of a single "game" or "program".
    Arduboys can run one sketch at a time, and some can only store one sketch at a time.
</p>

<h3>What is a "bootloader"?</h3>
<p>
    The bootloader is a program that runs when the device starts up, and manages communication with the computer
    and running user sketches. It is just another program, but it is special in that it is always the first to run
    and is protected from being overwritten. The bootloader is always run before a sketch.
    Even if your sketch does bad things, you can always reset your Arduboy to get back to the bootloader.
</p>

<h3>What is a "flashcart"?</h3>
<p>
    The flashcart is a binary blob full of sketches which is stored on an extra, larger flash memory on certain 
    Arduboy devices (Arduboy FX, Arduboy Mini). A special bootloader written by Mr.Blinky, called Cathy3K 
    (preinstalled on Arduboy FX and Arduboy Mini), is able to detect the presence of this larger flash memory 
    and boot into a menu which lets you select a game/program off the flashcart. When you flash sketches onto your 
    Arduboy when programming, the sketch does NOT go into the flashcart, you must modify the flashcart
    manually to include your game (this program can do that).
</p>

<h3>What is "Arduino?"</h3>
<p>
    Arduino is an open-source hardware and software platform + company. They provide inexpensive, off-the-shelf components
    using simple RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architectures to build small computing platforms, often used for
    robotics or other interesting small-scale computing requirements. Or in this case, to make fun 8-bit gaming consoles.
    You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">here (Wikipedia)</a>
</p>

<h3>What is "FX"?</h3>
<p>
    It's just a monicker for a modchip created by the community and then sold officially to upgrade the original
    Arduboy to have much more flash memory. Newer Arduboys simply included this chip by default, so those are 
    now "Arduboy FX".
</p>


<h2>Devices</h2>

<h3>What is the difference between Arduboy and Arduboy FX and the FX modchip?</h3>
<p>
    In the beginning, there was just the Arduboy with no "flashcart". It only had the 
    basic 32Kib flash used for a single "sketch", so you always had to connect your Arduboy
    to the computer to change the game. Then the community came up with an "FX" modchip you
    could add to the original Arduboy which added 16Mib of 'external' flash (external to the chipset,
    but still within the body of the Arduboy). With this and a new bootloader, now you could flash
    sketches off the big flashcart using a menu, effectively giving you access to hundreds of games
    on the same device. An official FX modchip was sold based of the community design for adding into
    your original Arduboy.
</p>
<p>
    Later, an official "Arduboy FX" was released which incorporated the 16Mib "FX" flash memory 
    directly, so you got an all-in-one package. Functionally, they are equivalent to an FX modded
    original Arduboy.
</p>
<p>
    Still later, an official "Arduboy Mini" was released, which is a smaller version of an Arduboy FX
    but with a slightly different configuration. Games which do not access the FX memory directly
    (most do not) can be run on all three devices, but games which do are compiled slightly differently,
    and are thus <b>not intercompatible</b>. So, if you see an FX enabled game, you must find the 
    mini-specific version if you have an Arduboy Mini.
</p>


<h3>What do I need to connect my Arduboy to the computer?</h3>
<p>
    Nothing other than a cable and the software you want to use with it. The Arduino IDE is not
    required to communicate with your Arduboy; it uses a basic protocol that anyone can use 
    over the standard COM/Serial interface.
</p>

<h3>What is this "SSD1306"?</h3>
<p>
    It's simply the parts number for the OLED screen used on the official Arduboy. You may see 
    references to it throughout the community, as people try to build their own Arduboys.
</p>

<h3>What is "SSD1309"?</h3>
<p>
    It's the parts number for a different OLED screen that's often used for DIY Arduboys. 
    It requires slightly different code to set up, so many programs offer a simple patch to 
    support these screens. If you have an official Arduboy, whether original, FX, or Mini, 
    you don't have to worry about that patch.
</p>

<h3>What is "Leonardo"?</h3>
<p>
    It's simply the codename for a set of Arduino boards. An Arduino Leonardo is used as the
    basis for Arduboy; it includes the microprocessor and various headers for stuff like a
    screen. If you wanted to build your own, you could buy an Arduino Leonardo
    and wire everything up yourself!
</p>

<h3>What is "ATmega32"?</h3>
<p>
    It's a specific "off the shelf" microcontroller that's used in some Arduino boards, such
    as the Arduino Leonardo used in Arduboy. It comes in several variants; only one is used
    in the official Arduboy: ATmega32U4. It has the 8-bit processor, 32Kib flash memory, 
    2.5Kib RAM, and 1Kib EEPROM all in one package.
</p>


<h2>Programs/Software</h2>

<h3>What is an FX-enabled game?</h3>
<p>
    Most sketches do nothing with the larger FX memory, they just operate within the bounds of their 
    own program. But some programs, using a special library, can read and write to the larger FX
    flash, greatly increasing the amount of data they have access to.
</p>
<p>
    There are two features FX-enabled games can use: they can read <b>data</b> from the flashcart
    for things like map data, sprites, text, etc, or they can read and write <b>save</b> data for
    larger saves. The Arduboy comes with a single 1024 byte EEPROM for saves, but all games share
    this same save area, so many clash with each other. Instead, a game can write its save in 
    4Kib chunks to the flashcart, making for way larger potential save data and no clashing
    (since each game gets its own reserved save spot in the flashcart).
</p>
<p>
    FX functionality is different between Arduboy FX + Arduboy Mini, so games which use this
    must compile separate programs for each of those devices.
</p>

<h3>What are .hex files?</h3>
<p>
    .hex files are compiled Arduboy/Arduino programs. You upload these to your arduboy, or put them into
    a flashcart. They are just text files filled with hexadecimal.
</p>

<h3>What are .ino files?</h3>
<p>
    .ino files are Arduboy/Arduino C++ code files. Programmers start a sketch by creating a main .ino file
    to house their game/program logic. These must be compiled before being put onto a device, as it's just code.
</p>

<h3>What are .arduboy files?</h3>
<p>
    .arduboy files are package files containing all the requisite data for an Arduboy program, along with 
    information about the authors and some images. They are highly useful for distributing Arduboy games,
    as some games require multiple files, and you can include multiple versions of your games (one for each 
    device type). They are simply renamed .zip files with an "info.json" file inside to describe the files 
    and package; you can extract them using any zip extractor. This program can read and write .arduboy files.
</p>

<h3>What is "AVR"?</h3>
<p>
    AVR is a processor architecture, kind of like ARM (but NOT ARM). It is the architecture used in a huge 
    variety of microcontrollers. It uses a "Modified Harvard Architecture" 8-bit RISC instruction set,
    which basically means it is a very small amount of instructions that do a very small amount of simple 
    things. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers">here (Wikipedia)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why Arduino? Why Arduboy?</h3>
<p>
    There's many kinds of hardware out there;
    most consumer hardware is proprietary and thus not easily modified or customized. Most consumer software (up until recently)
    is compiled for "x86" or other CISC (complex instruction set computer) architectures. These are so complicated that
    it requires layers and layers of systems to work, from special compilers to entire operating systems. There's kernels
    and security and the hardware is complicated and is thus expensive and requires a lot of power (and heat) to run.
    But small problems require small solutions; you wouldn't want to spend a bunch of money and time setting up a big
    hot processor and motherboard and all that just to make several motors spin on command. This is where platforms like
    Arduino shine: they use RISC (reduced instruction set computer) architectures and open, simple hardware designs and 
    basic tooling to give you low-cost hardware that you can "fully" program. You can usually get at every hardware line, 
    every interface/bus, every byte of memory at a very low level and do whatever you want, so it's very popular with 
    DIY hobbyists, robotics, and various simple devices.
</p>
<p>
    But also, some people just like to work in a simpler environment. Yes you can program big cool games in Unity or 
    simpler games in pygame or Godot or anything you want, but it's often daunting to consider the scope. If you want others
    to play your game, you have to consider multiple operating systems and hardware setups and weird resolutions,
    and you have to worry about assets and attribution or compensation for art + music and then distribution and aaaa 
    it's a lot. Sometimes it's nice to sit back and enjoy something simpler, or something where you can touch and see
    all the parts. Making a game on regular platforms usually means going through an insane amount of layers just to
    get something to show up on the screen; you're so far abstracted from the actual hardware and there's actually no
    reasonable way to see the "moving parts". Just as an example: about the lowest level for graphics is to program
    directly in OpenGL or Vulkan or some other library. Even that is an abstraction layer on top of the 
    numerous video interfaces + drivers that are possible, which then still has to go through the operating system
    before you get to the inscrutible (and usually proprietary) drivers for graphics devices, drivers for processors
    (because you still have to use the CPU when doing graphics), special protection rings, virtualization layers, 
    and even if you get down to the assembly, it still gets converted to proprietary microcode before the processor
    even does anything. And then graphics commands are sent over PCI, which is itself another protocol, through various buses,
    and then the graphics hardware is still an entire system on its own, with its own memory and... well you get the point,
    it's such a huge amount to take in if you want to get into the nitty-gritty. So it can often feel like you're programming
    in <i>someone else's</i> environment, like if you drew some art but then it has to go through a byzantine network
    of experts and scribes and notarizations and processes before coming out the other side.

<p>
    With Arduboy, if you wanted to, you could program directly in AVR assembly. There aren't many instructions,
    and all the cycle counts and side effects are well documented. Or, you could write your own compiler, if that's
    your thing. You don't have to use the community libraries, like Arduboy2 or the FX library, you could write them
    yourself. You could even write your own bootloader. You could replace the screen with something entirely different,
    or just build an entirely custom system from scratch. You could put a full color screen on there if you wanted!
    None of the existing programs would be compatible, but you could! It's all simple and open enough that real people
    can actually make the hardware do what they want, and that's really cool.
