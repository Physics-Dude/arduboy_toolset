<h1>Frequently Asked Questions on Arduboy</h1>


<h2>Terms</h2>

<h3>What is a "sketch"?</h3>
<p>
    A sketch is a program for Arduino. When you hear "sketch", you can think of a single "game" or "program".
    Arduboys can run one sketch at a time, and some can only store one sketch at a time.
</p>

<h3>What is a "bootloader"?</h3>
<p>
    The bootloader is a program that runs when the device starts up, and manages communication with the computer
    and running user sketches. It is just another program, but it is special in that it is always the first to run
    and is protected from being overwritten. The bootloader is always run before a sketch.
    Even if your sketch does bad things, you can always reset your Arduboy to get back to the bootloader.
</p>

<h3>What is a "flashcart"?</h3>
<p>
    The flashcart is a binary blob full of sketches which is stored on an extra, larger flash memory on certain 
    Arduboy devices (Arduboy FX, Arduboy Mini). A special bootloader written by Mr.Blinky, called Cathy3K 
    (preinstalled on Arduboy FX and Arduboy Mini), is able to detect the presence of this larger flash memory 
    and boot into a menu which lets you select a game/program off the flashcart. When you flash sketches onto your 
    Arduboy when programming, the sketch does NOT go into the flashcart, you must modify the flashcart
    manually to include your game (this program can do that).
</p>


<h2>Arduboy vs. Arduboy FX vs. Arduboy Mini etc.</h2>

<h3>What is the difference between Arduboy and Arduboy FX and the FX modchip?</h3>
<p>
    In the beginning, there was just the Arduboy with no "flashcart". It only had the 
    basic 32Kib flash used for a single "sketch", so you always had to connect your Arduboy
    to the computer to change the game. Then the community came up with an "FX" modchip you
    could add to the original Arduboy which added 16Mib of 'external' flash (external to the chipset,
    but still within the body of the Arduboy). With this and a new bootloader, now you could flash
    sketches off the big flashcart using a menu, effectively giving you access to hundreds of games
    on the same device. An official FX modchip was sold based of the community design for adding into
    your original Arduboy.
</p>
<p>
    Later, an official "Arduboy FX" was released which incorporated the 16Mib "FX" flash memory 
    directly, so you got an all-in-one package. Functionally, they are equivalent to an FX modded
    original Arduboy.
</p>
<p>
    Still later, an official "Arduboy Mini" was released, which is a smaller version of an Arduboy FX
    but with a slightly different configuration. Games which do not access the FX memory directly
    (most do not) can be run on all three devices, but games which do are compiled slightly differently,
    and are thus <b>not intercompatible</b>. So, if you see an FX enabled game, you must find the 
    mini-specific version if you have an Arduboy Mini.
</p>

<h2>FX-Enabled games</h2>

<h3>What is an FX-enabled game?</h3>
<p>
    Most sketches do nothing with the larger FX memory, they just operate within the bounds of their 
    own program. But some programs, using a special library, can read and write to the larger FX
    flash, greatly increasing the amount of data they have access to.
</p>
<p>
    There are two features FX-enabled games can use: they can read <b>data</b> from the flashcart
    for things like map data, sprites, text, etc, or they can read and write <b>save</b> data for
    larger saves. The Arduboy comes with a single 1024 byte EEPROM for saves, but all games share
    this same save area, so many clash with each other. Instead, a game can write its save in 
    4Kib chunks to the flashcart, making for way larger potential save data and no clashing
    (since each game gets its own reserved save spot in the flashcart).
</p>
<p>
    FX functionality is different between Arduboy FX + Arduboy Mini, so games which use this
    must compile separate programs for each of those devices.
