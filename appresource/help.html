<h1>Arduboy Toolset</h1>

<p>
    Arduboy toolset lets you upload + backup <b>sketches</b>, <b>flashcart data</b>, and <b>EEPROM</b>.
</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>

<p>
    Sketches are compiled singular programs, usually with a <b>.hex</b> extension. Sometimes a hex file will
    be embedded inside a <b>.zip</b> or <b>.arduboy</b> file. All three are accepted for upload to Arduboy.
    Note that Arduboy can only hold one sketch at a time, so uploading will overwrite whatever is currently
    there. 
</p>

<h2>Flashcart</h2>

<p>
    Arduboy FX and others with the "flashcart" have a special bootloader that boots before the sketch
    to allow you to choose one of many games on the additional flash memory (usually 16MB). The bootloader 
    will flash the game to the "sketch" area and boot into it, just like this tool does when you upload a 
    sketch.
</p>

<p> 
    You can generate flashcart <b>.bin</b> files by using the 
    <a href="http://www.bloggingadeadhorse.com/cart/Cart.html">Cart Builder</a> website. The bin
    file you download from there can be directly flashed to your Arduboy using the Flashcart upload 
    portion of this tool
</p>

<h2>EEPROM</h2>

<p>
    EEPROM is a small 1024 byte area made specifically for save game data. All games have to share the 
    same space for saves, so they often overwrite each other. You can backup + restore this data
    using this tool
