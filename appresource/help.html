<h1>Arduboy Toolset</h1>

<p>
    Arduboy toolset lets you upload + backup <b>sketches</b>, <b>flashcart data</b>, and <b>EEPROM</b>.
    There's a rudimentary <b>.arduboy</b> package creator with basic fields, and a separate <b>Cart Editor</b> 
    you can open from the <u>File</u> menu.
</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>

<p>
    Sketches are compiled singular programs, usually with a <b>.hex</b> extension. Sometimes a hex file will
    be embedded inside a <b>.zip</b> or <b>.arduboy</b> file. All three are accepted for upload to Arduboy.
    Note that Arduboy can only hold one sketch at a time, so uploading will overwrite whatever is currently
    there. 
</p>

<p>
    Some sketches use data stored on the "Fx" flash memory. These games usually go on a flashcart, so this 
    option is only used while developing FX games. It places the development FX data at the end of the
    flash memory, so you don't have to reflash an entire flashcart.
</p>

<p>
    The rest of the options on sketch upload are for special patches. They are not necessary if you have a
    regular Arduboy, they are mostly for DIY hardware.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> sketch backups you make are raw .bin files, which have to be turned back into .hex
    files before they can be reflashed. There's currently no way to do this yet, sorry! In the future,
    flash backups will be .hex files by default.
</p>

<h2>Flashcart</h2>

<p>
    Arduboy FX and others with the "Fx modchip" have a special bootloader that boots before the sketch
    to allow you to choose one of many games on the additional flash memory (usually 16MB). The bootloader 
    will flash the game you choose to the "sketch" area and boot into it, just like this tool does 
    when you upload a sketch.
</p>

<p> 
    You can generate flashcart <b>.bin</b> files by using the 
    <a href="http://www.bloggingadeadhorse.com/cart/Cart.html">Cart Builder</a> website. The bin
    file you download from there can be directly flashed to your Arduboy using the Flashcart upload 
    portion of this tool
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can use the <b>Cart Editor</b> located in the <u>File</u> menu. This lets you
    pull the FX flashcart off your device, make edits, and reflash it, but it also lets you create new
    flashcarts and save them to the filesystem, in the same .bin format used for flashing.
</p>

<h2>EEPROM</h2>

<p>
    EEPROM is a small 1024 byte area made specifically for save game data. All games have to share the 
    same space for saves, so they often overwrite each other. You can backup + restore this data
    using this tool
</p>

<h2>Package</h2>

<p>
    Arduboy games are generally distributed in a <b>.arduboy</b> file format. It's a simple zip archive 
    with the extension renamed, containing the game, extra data, images, and information about the game.
</p>

<p>
    You can generate basic <b>.arduboy</b> archives for distribution using this package generator. You 
    can also modify existing packages (such as updating the version + binaries inside).
</p>

<p>
    Note that this package generator does not have the complete set of fields supported by the 
    <b>.arduboy</b> format, but it is enough for most use cases. However, if you open a package
    which contains these extra fields, they will <b>not</b> be saved back when you save the 
    package. Use this package creator with caution. More fields may become available in the future.
