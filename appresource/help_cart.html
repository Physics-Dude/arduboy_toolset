<h1>Arduboy Toolset - Cart Editor</h1>

<p>
    This tool lets you modify FX flashcart <b>.bin</b> files directly. You can then reflash your Arduboy FX with
    the new flashcart. 
</p>

<p>
    So to modify the cart on your Arduboy, you might:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Open the flashcart off the Arduboy using the <b>File</b> menu in <u>Cart Editor</u>. It will take some time</li>
    <li>Use the <u>Cart Editor</u> to add or modify the games in the cart</li>
    <li>Flash the updated cart back to the Arduboy once again using the <b>File</b> menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If any games use the FX save feature, you will need to do this "direct" modification every time. It first loads
    the FX flashcart data into memory, so modifications are done locally (and can be saved to the filesystem) before
    being written back. Or, you could work strictly on backups, just keep in mind you'll lose any save games that 
    are stored on the FX chip (most games currently don't do this)
